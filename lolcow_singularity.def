#To build a container from this definition file (assuming it is a file named lolcow.def), you would call build like so:

#$ sudo singularity build lolcow.sif lolcow.def
#In this example, the header tells Singularity to use a base Ubuntu 16.04 image from the Container Library.

#The %post section executes within the container at build time after the base OS has been installed. The %post section is therefore the place to perform installations of new applications.

#The %environment section defines some environment variables that will be available to the container at runtime.

#The %runscript section defines actions for the container to take when it is executed.

#And finally, the %labels section allows for custom metadata to be added to the container. (https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html)
